This program organizes and removes duplicate songs in a folder.  :musical_note:  :file_folder:

My father has a LOT of songs saved in his computer. 
Some of those songs are in many different directories (The song "Let It Be" is saved in 4 different folders). Every time we listen to the songs in the car, we skip so many songs and
he gets angry at me for skipping so much and not paying attention to the traffic :angry:.


The system uses spotify and a database to search songs and singers.
Beofre using spotify to find the information I use a database of popular songs hoping the song will be there.
For accessing spotify we need to create a Spotify App and use the client id and secret provided in their site. 
Information in this link:
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/

For songs which have no singer in their name, I search spotify for their singer's name and arrange all the files with the same structure "{song} - {singer}" (so the 20 beatles songs I have won't be in a row... :weary: 

The folders created are for Hebrew and English Songs and divided by their names.

To use this program just put the songs in the folder "songs" and start the program. :blush:
